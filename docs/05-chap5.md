# Embodied time: Effect of reading expertise on the spatial representation of past and future {#chap5}



\initial{H}ow do people grasp the abstract concept of time? It has been argued that abstract concepts, such as future and past, are grounded in sensory-motor experience. When responses to words that refer to the past or the future are either spatially compatible or incompatible with a left-to-right timeline, a space-time congruency effect is observed. In the present study, we investigated whether reading expertise would determine the strength of the space-time congruency effect, which would suggest that learning to read and write drives the effect. We compared two types of space-time congruency effects, one where spatial incongruency was generated by the location of the stimuli on the screen and one where it was generated by the location of the responses on the keyboard. While the first type of incongruency was visuo-spatial only, the second involved the motor system. Results showed stronger space-time congruency effects for the second type of incongruency (i.e., when the motor system was involved) than for the first type (visuo-spatial). Crucially, reading expertise, as measured by a standardized reading test, predicted the size of the space-time congruency effects. Altogether, these results reinforce the claim that the spatial representation of time is grounded in spatially-directed movement, such as reading or writing.^[Ce chapitre expérimental est une version adaptée du manuscrit au format de la thèse.

## Introduction 

If abstract concepts are intangible, how could they be embodied through body-environment interactions? Embodied theories of language claim that concepts are represented through sensorimotor, interoceptive, and emotional networks that are activated when learning these concepts [e.g., @connell_interoception_2018; @vigliocco_neural_2014; @villani_sensorimotor_2021]. From this theoretical point of view, it is rather easy to conceive how the meaning of concrete words, such as *book*, could be embodied through sensorimotor experience [e.g., since books are usually handled manually, hearing or reading this word  supposedly activates hand-related motor networks; for some empirical evidence see for example @hauk_somatotopic_2004; @pulvermuller_functional_2005]. However, this is more complex for abstract concepts because we cannot physically ”grasp” them through our senses, nor easily identify the cognitive experience during development that led to the representation of abstract words.

Consider for instance the abstract concept of time. Although we can feel and conceptualize it, time is an elusive construct devoid of any concrete phenomenology [e.g., @evans_structure_2003; @lakoff_philosophy_1999]. There is no physical stimulus and no perceptual organ dedicated to time. In the absence of direct sensory experience of past and future, how could the brain construct a mental representation of time? One solution that has been proposed in the literature [e.g., @bergen_writing_2012; @eikmeier_dimensional_2013; @santiago_time_2007] is that time is represented spatially, flowing linearly from one position in space to another. Thus, temporal cognition is thought to reuse neural structures devoted to spatial cognition. 

This close link between space and time was theorized under the name of the mental timeline [for reviews see @bender_mapping_2014; @bonato_when_2012; @nunez_tangle_2013]. The mental timeline (MTL) refers to the phenomenon whereby individuals represent the temporal content of verbal stimuli (e.g., past and future) in two spatial axes that are centered on the body: for example, back-to-front (i.e., past in the back and future in the front; [e.g.,@miles_mapping_2010; @sell_processing_2011; @torralbo_flexible_2006; @ulrich_past_2012] and left-to-right (i.e., past on the left and future on the right  [e.g., @bergen_writing_2012; @grasso_as_2021; @santiago_time_2007; @weger_time_2008]. Empirical evidence for the MTL comes from experiments that manipulated congruency between the temporal content of verbal stimuli and the spatial position of the required response, resulting in a space-time congruency effect [e.g., @bender_mapping_2014; @bonato_when_2012; @lewandowska-tomaszczyk_mental_2016; @li_back_2019]. In various word or sentence processing tasks investigating the left-to-right MTL,  left-hand responses are typically faster than right-hand ones for past-tense stimuli and right-hand responses are faster than left-hand ones for future-tense stimuli [e.g., @eikmeier_response_2015; @kong_space-time_2012; @santiago_time_2007;  @torralbo_flexible_2006; for word stimuli, @maienborn_we_2015; @walker_disentangling_2014, for sentence stimuli].Interestingly, Li et al. (2018), showed that when people operate in their second language, bilinguals unconsciously retrieve irrelevant native language spatial representations that shape time conceptualization in real time. Further evidence for the implication of spatial neural networks in the representation of time comes from neuropsychological data in which hemispatial neglect patients who ignore the left side of space, also have difficulties representing past events [e.g., @anelli_effects_2018; @saj_patients_2014]. 
	
More recently, the hypothesis according to which words referring to time automatically activate neural motor circuits involved in spatial processing has been questioned [see @von_sobbe_space-time_2019, for a meta-analysis]. The argument was based on the finding that a strong and robust space-time congruency effect was found only when participants were asked to make an explicit judgment about the temporal content of verbal stimuli [e.g., @maienborn_we_2015; @ouellet_is_2010; @santiago_time_2007; @weger_time_2008]. However, @grasso_as_2021 have recently shown that robust space-time congruency effects can be observed even in an implicit temporal task (i.e., lexical decision about whether a word is real or not) as long as participants answer with a lateral movement of the hand. In four experiments, participants made lexical decisions to conjugated verbs or pseudoverbs and responded by either making spatially directed movements to the left or the right or by pressing a right or left response key. Space-time congruency effects occurred only for spatially directed movements, but not for button presses, regardless of whether the movement was performed with the hand [@grasso_as_2021] or with the eyes [@grasso_eye_2021]. These results suggested that left- or rightward movements through space are critical for observing the space-time congruency effect in implicit temporal tasks and therefore provide strong empirical support for automatic activation of motor planning networks in the (spatial) representation of time-related words.

The present study was designed to investigate two unresolved issues. First, if the activation of motor networks is critical for the occurrence of a space-time congruency effect during visual word processing, we hypothesized that the effect should be amplified when the space-time incongruency relies on the motor system (the left/right localisation of response keys) as opposed to when it relies only on the visual system (the left/right localisation of word stimuli on the screen). To test this hypothesis, we created incongruent associations (future to the left and past to the right) either on the screen (visual), or on the keyboard (motor) or both on the screen and the keyboard. Second, if the directionality of the MTL (future to the right and past to the left) is related to the directionality of reading and writing, we hypothesized that reading expertise should correlate positively with the size of the space-time congruency effect. 

As concerns the second hypothesis, it has been suggested that the left-to-right MTL in western languages results from motor experience related to reading and writing. During writing, our hands, eyes, and attention move spatially from left to right, gradually shifting from what has been read/written - the past - to what will be read/written -the future- [e.g., @hutchison_can_2010; @fuhrman_mental_2007; @pitt_reading_2016]. Empirically, this hypothesis is based on a large amount of cross-cultural data showing that the direction of the space-time congruency effect follows the direction of the participants’ writing system [e.g., @fuhrman_mental_2007; @ouellet_is_2010]. Whereas in cultures that read and write from left to right, participants are faster to respond to past tense items with their left hand and future tense items with their right hand [e.g., @kong_space-time_2012; @santiago_time_2007; @torralbo_flexible_2006; @ulrich_leftright_2010; @walker_spatial_2017; @weger_time_2008], the reverse pattern is found for participants whose writing system operates from right-to-left [e.g., Hebrew scripts, @fuhrman_mental_2007]. @casasanto_spatial_2014 were the first to directly assess the causal influence of reading expertise on the space-time congruency effect. In their study, Dutch participants had to judge the temporal content of sentences written either in a standard direction or in a mirror-reversed direction. Results revealed that the direction of space-time associations followed the direction of eye and hand movements: that is, left-past and right-future associations when participants had to read sentences in the standard left-to-right direction, and right-past and left-future associations when participants had to read sentences in the right-to-left direction [for another exemple, see @pitt_reading_2016]. These space-time congruency effects suggest that reading experience plays a role in the direction in which time is spatially represented. 
 
If the abstract concept of time is grounded in the directional movements performed during reading and writing, then the space-time congruency effect should correlate positively with the degree of reading and writing expertise of the participants: more experienced readers should be more sensitive to space-time incongruities. Recently, the link between reading expertise and the processing of temporal order (i.e., before vs. after) was investigated in a developmental study using non-verbal stimuli [@autry_development_2020]. Participants, ranging from preschoolers to adults, had to represent the temporal order of coloured circles presented sequentially on a computer by placing coloured cards in front of them [@autry_development_2020]. Results revealed a left-to-right bias in organizing the order of events, even in preschoolers. Crucially, results showed that the more children were familiar with reading, the more they organized the temporal order of events from left-to-right. Nevertheless, the claim that the depth of reading and writing experience correlates with the strength of the spatial representation of past and future words still lacks direct empirical evidence. 

Based on these theoretical and empirical considerations, the present study was designed to investigate the role of motor function and reading expertise in the space-time congruency effect that is observed during lexical processing of the abstract concept of time (i.e., past and future related words). One way to investigate the role of motor function in the space-time congruency effect is to manipulate whether congruency occurs at the perceptual (visual) or motor level. For instance, in @santiago_time_2007 participants had to categorize past and future words presented either on the left or right side of the screen, and to make lateralized static keyboard responses using their left or right hand. Two types of space-time congruency were manipulated. First, the congruency between the temporal content of the stimuli (past/future) and the left/right spatial location of the stimuli on the screen (i.e., perceptual congruency on screen), which is independent of motor execution. Second, the congruency between the temporal content of the stimuli and the left/right spatial location of responses on the keyboard, which depends on motor execution (i.e., motor congruency on the keyboard). Participants performed the same temporal categorisation twice: once with congruent key responses, and once with incongruent key responses in a counterbalanced order. Space-time congruency effects occurred in both the perceptual and motor conditions, suggesting that incongruency on either the screen or the keyboard can interfere with performance. However, in Santiago’s et al. study, no comparative analysis between these two space-time congruency conditions was conducted. In the present study, we will directly compare the effect size of the two conditions.

To investigate the role of reading expertise in the space-time congruency effect - and thus the spatial representation of time -, we included two reading proficiency measures. First, we used a French version of a computerized reading test which measures both reading comprehension and reading speed of sentences [i.e., SLS-Berlin, @ludtke_sls-berlin_2019]. It has been shown that the SLS-Berlin is an excellent tool for screening interindividual variability in reading expertise [@ludtke_sls-berlin_2019]. Second, to assess language proficiency, we used the Lextale_FR [@brysbaert_lextale_fr_2013] commonly used in the literature to screen participants’ vocabulary size.

In sum, the present study was designed to investigate in a single explicit temporal task the role of motor function and reading expertise in the space-time congruency effect. Since we replicate the experiment by @santiago_time_2007, we should observe the same pattern of results; that is, space-time congruency effects in both the screen and the keyboard conditions. Furthermore, since recent work suggests that motor planning plays a crucial role in lexical processing of the temporal content of words [e.g., @grasso_as_2021; @grasso_eye_2021], we predicted a stronger space-time congruency effect size in the keyboard-congruent condition as compared to the screen-congruent condition. Finally, we predicted a positive correlation between the size of the space-time congruency effect and reading expertise.

## Materials and Methods

### Participants 

Since one of the main objectives of the present study was to assess the link between reading expertise and the space-time congruency effect, we conducted the study in a wide range of ages in the general population rather than in undergraduate psychology students. This was done to increase inter-individual differences in reading expertise. Thus, ninety adults ranging in age from 18 to 72 years old participated in the experiment. Four adults were not included in the final analyses due to high error rate (i.e., >15%). Three others participants had abnormal or aberrant RT distributions (many very fast or slow responses, or huge variability) and the data from these participants were excluded from the final analysis. The remaining 83 participants (36 women, 70 right-handed) were all French native speakers, reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and ranged in age from 18 to 72 years old (*M* = 30.69; *SD* = 10.97). All participants were recruited online, through the Prolific.ac website and received 10€/hours for their participation. The study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, and it approved by the Institutional Review Board of Aix-Marseille University. 

### Design and Stimuli 

We selected 84 past tense conjugated verbs and 84 future tense conjugated verbs from the Lexique 3 database [@new_lexique_2004]. Past and future words were matched with respect to length (7.92 versus 7.99 letters, *p* = .65, for past versus future words, respectively) and frequency (19.27 versus 8.42 occurrences per million, *p* = .11, for past versus future words, respectively). We used a Latin-Square design for creating 4 lists of 168 stimuli each (84 past words and 84 future words). Half of the past- or future- words could appear on the left of the screen and the other half on the right. For each session, participants saw one of the four lists, with each word presented once only and in random order.

### Apparatus 

The experiment was programmed in PHP, JAVASCRIPT, and HTML, and was made available online. All participants performed the online experiment on their own personal computer and were asked to respond with their keyboard by pressing the “S” key for left-responses with their left-hand or the “L” key for right-responses with their right hand (AZERTY keyboard). All words were presented in 30-point arial font in black on a white background. When opening the web link of the online experiment, each participant was assigned to one of the four lists. We collected latencies (i.e., time between the onset of the stimulus and participants’ responses) measured with millisecond precision (see Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig1)).

\end{figure}

### Procedure 

The experiment consisted of a temporal categorization task (does the stimulus refer to the past or the future?). Detailed instructions were displayed when opening the web link of the experiment. Participants were asked to perform the experiment in a quiet environment with no acoustic or visual distractions, and to start the task after completing a demographic questionnaire (i.e., age, gender, education level and dominant hand for writing). The experiment consisted of two independent sessions of 168 trials each, separated by 5 days and lasted for approximately 15 minutes. A participation link for the second session was sent to the participants 5 days after the first session. The tasks (temporal categorization) in both sessions were strictly identical except for the key response mapping, that is, in one session, the left-past and right-future response represented a space-time congruent key mapping, whereas in the other session the left-future and right-past response represented a space-time incongruent key mapping. The order of presentation of key response mapping was counterbalanced across participants. Instructions explained that words would appear either on the left or right side of the screen, which would always be preceded by a red cross to indicate where the word would appear. All participants were instructed to decide as rapidly and as accurately as possible whether the stimulus was a past- or future-word by pressing the left- or right-key of an AZERTY keyboard with their left and right hands, respectively. For each session, participants saw a total of 84 past-tense words and 84 future-tense words, presented in random order with half of each on the left of the screen and half on the right. As can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig1), at the beginning of each trial, a red fixation cross was displayed for 1200ms on the side where the word would appear, followed by a blank display for 500ms and then the stimulus (e.g., I drew) remained on the screen until the participants’ response. Participants were asked to stop answering when they felt the need to take a break, and to resume when ready.

Note that independently of the type of stimuli presented, the combination of left-right stimulus locations on the screen together with left-right key responses could trigger the well-known Simon compatibility effect [e.g., @simon_effect_1990; @zorzi_computational_1995]. When asked to produce a response at a location that is congruent with the spatial location of the stimulus on the screen (e.g., left key response for a left-sided stimulus), participants give faster responses than in incongruent trials (e.g., right key response for a left-sided stimulus). Although @santiago_time_2007 found no interaction between stimulus location on the screen and response location on the keyboard, which suggests the absence of a Simon effect, we added Simon congruency as a predictor in our statistical analyses to isolate space-time congruency from the (non-temporal) Simon effect. Altogether, the experiment therefore comprised four congruency conditions summarized as the A, B, C and D conditions, as depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig2). All stimuli can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

The figure illustrates the four congruency conditions for left-sided stimuli.  Four equivalent conditions were also presented for right-sided stimuli.}(\#fig:chap-5-fig2)
\end{figure}

To assess language proficiency, participants completed the Lextale_FR [@brysbaert_lextale_fr_2013].  After the categorisation task in the first session, a link automatically redirected participants to the Lextale_FR [@brysbaert_lextale_fr_2013]. This task consists of fixed presentation of 120 words and pseudowords in the centre of the screen, separated by a 1200ms blank screen. Participants had to decide whether the words exist by pressing the left or right key on their personal keyboard.  Reading proficiency was measured by the French version of the SLS-Berlin in the second session [@ludtke_sls-berlin_2019].  After the categorisation task in the second session, a link automatically redirected participants to the SLS-Berlin [@ludtke_sls-berlin_2019]. The French version of the SLS-Berlin consisted of the successive presentation of 77 correct or incorrect sentences (e.g., "Drunk drivers have a slower reaction time." or "A rhinoceros is a wind instrument.", respectively) at the centre of the screen, separated by a 1200ms blank screen and in a fixed order. Participants were asked to judge the plausibility or implausibility of the sentences by pressing a left or right key on their keyboard. The task stopped automatically after 3 minutes of sentence presentation (this duration did not include inter-stimulus intervals). 

### Data analysis

We recorded and analyzed response accuracy (error rates, in percentage) and response latency (in milliseconds), that is the time interval between the onset of the stimulus and participants’ keyboard response. Aberrant values corresponding to trials with latencies greater than 4000ms and less than 250ms (0.58% of trials) were discarded from the analyses. Response latencies were all inverse transformed (-1000 / RT) and predictors of participants' reading expertise (measured by the Lextale_FR and the SLS_Berlin) were standardized prior to analyses. 

Analyses of accuracy and latencies (for correct responses) were conducted with linear mixed-effects models [@baayen_mixed-effects_2008] using the `lmer()` and `glmer()` functions from the `lme4` package [@bates_fitting_2015] in the `R` statistical computing environment [@r_core_team_r_2020]. We report unstandardized regression coefficients (b), standard errors (SEs), |t| or |F| values (for lmer), |z| values (for glmer), standardized mean difference (SMD, effect size), and corresponding p-values. For multilevel predictors (e.g., condition), we report the F-values of the main effect, standard errors (SEs) and corresponding p-values computed with the anova() function from the lmerTest package [@kuznetsova_lmertest_2017]. We also report unstandardized regression coefficients (b), |Z| values and corresponding p-values for contrasts analyses computed with the `pairwise()` function from the `emmeans` package [@lenth_emmeans_2021]. Regarding model building, we used the maximal random structure model that reached convergence [@barr_random_2013]. The final model included by-participant and by-item random intercepts in all analyses that we report. In a forward stepwise model selection procedure, fixed and random effects of the models were selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion [AIC, @akaike_maximum_1973], the Bayesian Information Criterion [BIC, @schwarz_estimating_1978], and the chi-squared log-likelihood ratio tests with regular maximum likelihood parameter estimation using the `anova()` function of the `lmerTest` package [@kuznetsova_lmertest_2017] for model comparison. Therefore, fixed effects, random effects, and random slopes were only included if they significantly improved the model’s fit. Assumptions of the model were checked for each model: the normality of the residual distribution and dispersion were inspected using the `simulateresiduals()` function from the `DHARMa` [@hartig_dharma_2021] package for `glmer` models, and residual distribution were checked visually by plotting the residuals’ `Quantile-Quantile` (QQ) and the normality of the distribution of the random effects by plotting the QQ-plots with the `qqmath()` function [from `Lattice` package, @sarkar_lattice_2008] and the `ranef()` function for `lmer` models. Effect sizes for each predictor of the model were computed using the `eff_size()` function of the `emmeans` package [@lenth_emmeans_2021]. The `eff_size()` function computes a standardised mean difference, using pairwise differences of estimates divided by the (estimated) standard deviation of the population.To create figures, we used the `emmeans` package [@lenth_emmeans_2021] that allowed us to compute the estimated marginals means (EMMs) for each model (see for instance Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig4)). 

## Results

### Reaction times

The final model included Simon congruency (congruent vs. incongruent), screen congruency (congruent vs. incongruent), keyboard congruency (congruent vs. incongruent), and participant age as fixed effects, as well as standardized reading expertise (expressed by the sum of correct responses in the SLS-Berlin) and its interaction with each type of congruency, and by-participant and by-time intercepts. Results revealed a marginal effect of age (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 1.79, *p* =.076), a significant effect of reading expertise (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 3.79, *p* < .001), a significant Simon congruency effect (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 3.05, *p* < .001, *SMD* = 0.046), and a significant space-time congruency effect of key response mapping (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 8.18, *p* < .001, *SMD* = 0.131) (Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig3)).   However, there was no significant space-time congruency effect of screen location (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 1.28, *p* = .259, *SMD* = 0.024). Interestingly, analyses revealed a significant interaction between reading expertise and space-time congruency of both key response mapping (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 6.24, *p* < .001) and screen location (*b* = -0.00, *SE* = 0.00, *t* = 2.25, *p* = .024), but no interaction with Simon congruency (*b* = -0.01, *SE* = 0.01, *t* = 2.25, *p* =.024). In other words, the better the reading expertise of the participants, the stronger the space-time congruency effect of the key response mapping and of the spatial location of the stimulus on screen (Figure \@ref(fig:chap-5-fig3)).

### Error rate 

No significant effect was observed for error rate. Note that error rate was low (2.46%). 

## Discussion 

The present study was designed to investigate whether the space-time congruency effect in an explicit temporal task would be stronger if the congruency manifested itself in motor responses (keyboard congruency) rather than perceptual input (screen congruency). Second, on the basis of the assumption that the spatial representation of the temporal content of words and its directionality derives from the accumulation of writing and reading experience [e.g., @casasanto_spatial_2014; @fuhrman_mental_2007; @pitt_reading_2016; @tillman_mental_2018] we assessed whether reading expertise positively correlated with the size of the space-time congruency effect. 

To this end, we combined reading expertise measures with an adapted version of the paradigm used by @santiago_time_2007. This paradigm allowed us to manipulate two types of space-time congruency: 1) screen congruency; the congruency between the temporal content of stimuli (past vs. future) and their spatial location on screen (left vs. right), which is independent of motor execution, and 2) keyboard congruency; the congruency between the temporal content of stimuli (past vs. future) and the associated key responses on the keyboard (left vs. right), which involves motor execution. Combining lateralization of stimuli on the screen and lateralization of responses on the keyboard incidentally produced a Simon congruency condition, which was independent of the experimental manipulation of space-time congruency and was controlled for in the analyses. Several predictions were made: 1) as we replicated the same explicit temporal task used by @santiago_time_2007, we should observe the same pattern of results, that is space-time congruency effects both for screen congruency and keyboard congruency conditions, 2) if lexical processing of the temporal content of words relies on both motor planning and spatial networks, then we should observe a stronger space-time congruency effect under the keyboard congruency condition, in which motor execution is needed, compared to the screen congruency condition (i.e., cumulative effect), 3) if this spatial representation of time derives from the directional movement executed while reading, then space-time congruency effects, but not the Simon congruency effect, should correlate positively with participants' reading expertise.

Statistical analyses revealed a classic Simon congruency effect, which was independent of the two space-time congruency effects. All other things being equal, participants were slower for trials in which target location on the screen and response location on the keyboard were opposed. Crucially, our results revealed a strong space-time congruency effect under the keyboard congruency condition. Average response times to complete the task were significantly longer when key responses contradicted the spatial organisation of time according to the MTL (i.e., left-future and right-past key responses), independently of other congruency conditions and of the order in which the congruent or incongruent response-mappings were given. As predicted, the effect of space-time keyboard congruency interacted with the level of reading expertise, with a higher level of reading expertise being associated with a stronger space-time congruency effect. Although the effect of space-time screen congruency was not significant in itself, it was nevertheless influenced by reading expertise,  that is the higher the participants’ level of reading expertise, the larger the size of the space-time screen congruency effect. 

Importantly, the congruency effect was stronger for the keyboard congruency condition (*SMD* = 0.131) as compared to screen congruency condition (*SMD* = 0.025). In other words, the space-time congruency effect was stronger when it was implemented via a motor response, suggesting that motor networks are engaged when processing the temporal tense of a word. Altogether, these results indicate that the abstract temporal concepts of past and future are represented in both spatial and motor networks.   

Crucially, participants’ reading expertise correlated significantly with the size of the space-time congruency effect but not with the Simon effect. As Simon congruency is fully independent of the lexical content of stimuli, this dissociation considerably strengthens the hypothesis that the direction of the spatial representation of time (i.e., the MTL) may derive from the direction of movement during reading and writing experience [e.g., @casasanto_spatial_2014; @fuhrman_mental_2007; @pitt_reading_2016; @tillman_mental_2018]. Furthermore, conducting an online experiment allowed us to test a large sample of the population across a considerable age range. The final mixed model included participant age as a predictor, allowing us to estimate the effect of expertise while controlling for age. Interestingly, controlling for the effect of age did not modulate the effect of reading expertise and its interaction with space-time congruency effects. This suggests that the driving force behind this correlation is specific to reading experience rather than general life experience (chronological age). 

Overall, these results replicate previous findings [@grasso_as_2021; @grasso_eye_2021; @sell_processing_2011] and reinforce the hypothesis that the lexical processing of temporal stimuli is underpinned by motor networks, in addition to spatial brain structures. The significant interaction between reading expertise and space-time congruency effects accounts for the correlation between people’s cultural habits (i.e., direction of eye movements while reading) and their tendency to organize time spatially on a left-to-right mental timeline. This result is in line with the claim that the use of spatial and motor networks for the representation of time results from reading and writing experience that creates an association between the movement of the eyes and hands rightwards or leftwards through space and the chronological order in which the left and right sides of space are experienced (e.g., Casasanto & Bottini, 2014b). 

As for the neural mechanisms that associate sensorimotor and spatial networks to the semantic representation of time, the neural reuse model [e.g., @garagnani_neuroanatomically_2008; @pulvermuller_neural_2018] provides an interesting explanation. This model uses basic neurobiological insights about the formation of neural networks  such as Hebbian learning – and, in particular, correlational learning – to explain how a set of sensory and motor neurons could be functionally involved in semantic processing. In short, the correlated patterns of neural activity that are present whenever a word or concept is experienced leads to the formation of strongly interconnected sets of cells distributed over the brain called action-perception circuits (APC). Regarding the abstract concept of time, it could be hypothesized that repeated experience of movements that start at one point in space and end later in time at another point associate spatial and temporal information together via correlated neural mechanisms.  Repeated correlational patterns would ultimately constitute an APC consisting of, among other things, sensorimotor and spatial networks that would be automatically activated during the processing of the concept of time.
	
To conclude, we would like to cite @buonomano_your_2017: “The nervous system of animals evolved sophisticated ways to represent spatial coordinates, such as up and down, left and right, before it developed the ability to explicitly represent the temporal continuum of past, present and future. This line of reasoning is consistent with the theory that our ability to grasp the concept of time was coopted from the neural circuits that evolved to navigate, represent and understand space” (Buonomano, 2017, p. 182).

Comment l’individu acquière une représentation porteuse de sens pour des mots qui désignent un concept aussi abstrait que celui de temps ? Tout au long de ce manuscrit, nous avons étudié les conditions d'émergence d’effets de congruence spatio-temporelle, qui se traduisent par des temps de réponses plus rapides lorsque le contenu temporel de mots à traiter sont congruents avec l'organisation spatiale de la ligne mentale temporelle (i.e., passé à gauche et futur à droite). L’étude décrite dans ce dernier chapitre expérimental examinait deux questions : i) celle de la contribution respective des caractéristiques visuelles et motrices à l'effet de congruence spatio-temporelle, ii) et celle du rôle de l'expertise de la lecture dans l'effet de congruence spatio-temporelle. À cette fin, nous avons comparé deux conditions de congruence spatio-temporelle. Dans la première, la situation d’incongruence spatiale était générée par l'emplacement des réponses sur le clavier, tandis que dans la seconde l'incongruence spatiale était générée par l'emplacement des stimuli sur l'écran. Les résultats ont montré des effets de congruence spatio-temporelle plus forts lorsque l’incongruence spatio-temporelle était générée par le mouvement au clavier. Le deuxième résultat intéressant ici est que l'expertise en lecture, telle que mesurée par un test de lecture standardisé, prédisait la taille des effets de congruence spatio-temporelle. Dans l'ensemble, ces résultats corroborent l’hypothèse selon laquelle la représentation spatiale du temps prendait racine dans des mouvements dirigés dans l'espace, comme la lecture ou l'écriture. L’ensemble des données présentées dans ces trois chapitres expérimentaux sera discuté dans le prochain chapitre.
